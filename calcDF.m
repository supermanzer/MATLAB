function [ df ] = calcDF(x,type,y )
%calcDF This function calculates effective degrees of freedom for one or
%two timeseries data vectors.  If two time sries are provided it determines
%the most conservative (longest decorrelation time) value to return.
%   INPUTS
%       x - data vector to be analyzed for decorrelation time
%       type - optional type of degrees of freedom to be calculated.  If
%       absent the first zero crossing will be used. Only "zc" for first
%       zero crossing or "ef" for first e-folding are valid values.
%       y - Optional second data vector.  If provided the effective degrees
%       of freedom will be whichever data vector has the smaller degrees of
%       freedom.
