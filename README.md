# MATLAB
This is a repository for MATLAB code that I have developed for my own (mostly scientific and academic) studies.  I welcome all sincerely interested comments and suggestions.

I am an MS student who uses MATLAB to analyze oceanographic data.  I hope to produce code and analyses that some marine ecosystem stakeholders may find of interest or useful.  Eventually I would like to transition to Python but much of my education in data analysis has been in MATLAB so it's the fastest tool for development at present.

tgaps.m:  A function used to find gaps in time vector of time series data (e.g. when instruments are being serviced 		  and no data is logged).

nanFuncs:  A series of functions used to finding NaN values and interpolating over them if they fall within user 		   specified parameters.
