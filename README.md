# MATLAB
This is a repository for MATLAB code that I have developed for my own (mostly scientific and academic) studies.  I welcome all sincerely interested comments and suggestions.

I am an MS student who uses MATLAB to analyze oceanographic data.  I hope to produce code and analyses that some marine ecosystem stakeholders may find of interest or useful.  Eventually I would like to transition to Python but much of my education in data analysis has been in MATLAB so it's the fastest tool for development at present
